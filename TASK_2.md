## Task 2:

**To be done separately by each sub-group**

Each sub-group has to write queries for all the 15 **[Questions](Questions.md)**. The questions can be divided among individual member of the sub-group alternatively. i.e 1, 3, 5, 7 ... for a member and 2, 4, 6, 8... for other. Or however the division is convenient.

Students are supposed to write and run the queries using the query tool provided by the pgAdmin. The results should match the ones as mentioned in the expected result.
